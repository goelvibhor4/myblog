<p>Hackathons are very common these days and, if you’ve been there once, you know they are typically full of coders,designers and entrepreneurs .If in case you don’t know what is a hackathon, a  hackathon is a community oriented occasion where many individuals with both technical and non-technical ability get together and find solutions to  problems. 
</p>
<br>
<p>So,Last month I attended appathon organised by venturesity. Having attended all of my previous hackathons as coder, I wanted to be around the energy but did’nt wanted to hack this time, so I decided to volunteer during the weekend. This hackathon was organised by PayUMoney in collaboration with Venturesity and focused on Building Financial Mobile Applications. Attendees were given a set of problem statements and were asked to built mobile application solving these problems.  And the best part, You might get hired. Yes, this was a hack for hire event, so teams/individuals that performed good were hired.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Here are key things that I learnt from venturesity hackathon:
</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">1.Hackathons are new hiring platform.</h2>

<p>Hackathons are picking up popularity among innovation organizations. At first it was seen as an occasion for nerds, however now it has turned into a standard hiring system.In case you're looking to score job at one of the top-level organizations, hackathons are one of the most ideal approaches to emerge among different candidates. Hackathons are regularly more engaging than a traditional walk-in interviews.
</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">2. My college does not teaches how to hack.Simply doesn’t. </h2>

<p>If we are serious about preparing our youth to enter the workforce,we have to urge each college student to tune in hackathons. They will figure out how to code, additionally, all the more critically, they will get to be enthusiastic about building things. By participating in hackathons,college students will be working collaboratively and will get to work on interesting problems.
</p>                    
<h2 class="section-heading">3.Hackathons help you build great network</h2>

<p>One of the best things about attending a hackathon is hearing first-hand from experienced developers and connecting with other participants.
I've observed that the most important things I've increased through hackathons are the connections that constructed through the experience. There's something about spending a whole night hacking with a gathering of individuals that truly manufactures an enduring bond. 
</p>
  <br>

<p>Hackathons are great. You hang out all night long, eat junk food, listen to music. You get to meet successful people who have their own start-ups.
Many thanks to Payu money for hosting the event in their office space, being so welcoming, accommodating, liberal and giving the prizes. Also thanks to the organisers of the event itself; Venturesity who arranged the concept and event sign-up.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Looking forward to attend more hackathons and promote hacking culture.</p>
