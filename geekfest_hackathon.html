<p>Last weekend, I went to GeekFest hackathon , had a great time and learning experiences. Our group did not win but still managed to enjoy the sleepless night and each one of us did receive a considerable measure in return.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This hackathon was organised by IBM in collaboration with 91Springboard. It was an Open Data Hackathon where participants had to build apps around the data sets available at https://data.gov.in/ and deploy them on the PaaS awesomeness by IBM Bluemix. Since the theme was announced two days well in advance before the “day”, we had some time to figure out how IBM Bluemix worked, of which we would have been clueless if it had been a surprise at the event day.

</p>
<br>
<p>So here’s a quick summary of my experience and what I learned.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">1.Attend with an idea.</h2>

<p>This is one major decision, because you’ll have a very limited amount of time, and off course with limited resources. The idea should be well planned before the execution really begins. Even though we had thought of few ideas in advance, it was quite confusing to settle with one when the hackathon started. We spent nearly 5-6 hours finalizing our idea ,which we could have easily saved with little better planning and management.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">2.Network with people.</h2>

<p>Yes, every geek comes to hackathon to code but that doesn't mean that you would end up spending all of your time developing prototype and debugging errors. Exchanging ideas and hanging out with other programmers certainly make up a significant part of the experience. Take regular breaks from coding and roam around to know fellow participants and interact with them.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">3.Don’t hesitate to consult a mentor.</h2>

<p>Hackathons are a unique platform to have good mentorship with ease, take that opportunity of trying something hard and getting extra “free” but valuable help. Mentors and fellow developers can be a great source of learning. Interact with as many people as you can, present them your problem - you never know who lands you up with that winning idea. My special thanks to Aseem Gautam, founder at Housted.com and Kshitish Purohit, Paperkite for being such a good source of inspiration and guidance in this hackathon.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">4.Concentrate on MVP (Minimal viable Product) not whole product.</h2>

<p>Hackathons are all about getting stuff done. At the end of the day, what really matters is how well did you execute your idea. Hacking on new product usually involves learning new technology and thus, you may end up spending more time working on it than you had even thought. Start with a bare minimum features and you may keep on adding new ones as you complete previous ideas.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">5.Always showcase your product.</h2>

<p>One easy way to mess up your 24 hour coding hard work is “not showcasing it”. Regardless of how much your product is developed , demo something. Something done is any day better than nothing. Once you will showcase even a small part of your product, you may get a chance to gain valuable feedback from mentors and fellow developers. Believe me, this is one very important part of “The Experience”.</p>

                <br>

<p>n all, we had a great deal of fun and a great learning experience at the Hackathon weekend, motivating and inspiring us to keep going. The whole experience was one of its kind. Got to meet some cool, geeky and like minded people.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Apra sahney and Rajesh Jeyapaul and rest of the IBM team, venue partner 91springboard( one good reason I love to go to hackathons here) for putting this up. Looking forward to more such events from IBM.</p>
