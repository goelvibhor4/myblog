                    <p>After completing my summer internship at a digital marketing agency last summer, I realized working for a startup can be the best thing one can experience in college life.Working in a startup can be fun and exciting.You will be Hanging out with brilliant and creative individuals, looking into things you never knew existed . I would really Suggest taking some time out of your studies to work at a startup and get your hands dirty and really encounter startup life before you graduate. I’m one-sided obviously, on the grounds that I invest the majority of my time in reading as well as learning about startups and entrepreneurship.But here are top reasons why I recommend you should also work for startups:</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">1.You are surrounded by cool individuals, and they are all really near your own particular age.</h2>

                    <p>At a startup, you’ll additionally get the chance to work directly with the individuals accountable for running the organization . You’ll get enough chances to make inquiries, pick their brains, and get a thought of the sorts of choices they’re making .They will also include you in decision making process which I think is an amazingly significant asset.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">2.You’ll figure out how to come up short.</h2>

<p>This is by far the top reason why I love working for startups. After working with a startup you’ll learn how to built contacts.Your co-workers can transform into incredible companions and extraordinary business contacts for a considerable length of time to come.
What I learned? While working for a startup, you must be very motivated toward oneself to learn anything or accomplish anything; whereas in college, everything is extremely organized, the pace is situated, and so forth.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">3. Startup means multitasking.</h2>

<p>If you are working in startups ,it likely means you’re a piece of a little group, no doubt in the single digits.Having the capacity to accomplish more with less is the thing that drives a startup towards progress. You have minimal in the method for cash, time, and assets, to do what organizations ten times bigger than yours neglect to do.
</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">4.You’ll Build Great Contacts</h2>

<p>At an early-stage startup, time is significant, and each colleague is important including interns. This implies that you’ll be dealing with real life scenarios that specifically affect clients. You will have an ownership of important projects so you will have to deliver your best.You’ll have deadlines to meet which will actually teach you the real importance of completing the work on time.
</p>


                <br>

<p>Anyway after having a decent involvement in this field I would recommend you one thing, this isn't the way for everyone, and there are drawbacks. You might feel “I don’t have enough time in the day” issue. I thought I had little time for myself before working for startups. Presently I recognize what occupied is. Also,In college, individuals are continually asking you “what do you need do after you graduate?” and debating over this question for hours. Then my simple answer to them is “Do what you Love !!”. Just follow your dreams.</p>
