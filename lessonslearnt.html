<p>College is a period where we never quit finding out about ourselves and never stop growing as an individual. I believe that there is more to the college experience than sitting in libraries and focusing purely on your CGPA. College is an amazing experience, where you meet new people, find interesting new things to do, and learn a lot about yourself. </p>
<p>I've also  had some incredible life experiences.None of the lessons I learned came easily.
Here are just a few of the numerous lessons I learned in three years of my college life:</p>            


                    <h2 class="section-heading">1.Learn how to manage stress.</h2>

<p>At whatever point I had a feeling that everything was turning out to be a lot for me to handle I used to put the outside world on hold for a few days. I truly believe despite what you do, give yourself some time every once in a while to temporarily forget about all of life's responsibilities and enjoy your own company.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">2.You can’t please everyone.</h2>

<p>Some people will always tell you what you did wrong, and then hesitate to compliment you for what you did right.  Don’t be one of them, and don’t put up with them.Simply walk away  because any bit of time you spend on these people will be wasted.
</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">3.There’s no such thing as destiny.</h2>

<p> I would really put it simple “Work hard and get rewards for them”.Believing good days will come and sitting and doing nothing will certainly not help . Your main motive should be doing good. we should stop blaming other and we must believe that "everything is our own responsibility</p>
 
 
  <h2 class="section-heading">4.You can't work and travel at the same time.</h2>


<p>Many of us just love to travel so do I. But you have to accept the bitter fact that travel and work can’t be handled simultaneously. Either of them would be affected if done at same time. it would be better if we choose to do one thing at a time and enjoy it to fullest.
</p>
 <h2 class="section-heading">5. Don’t know anything ,Just say “I don’t know”.</h2>

<p>Asking question if you don't know something is just a good habit. There are plenty of people around who love to share knowledge with peers and this is certainly how community moves forward.There is always an opportunity to learn something out of nothing. 

</p>
 <h2 class="section-heading">6. Try new things.</h2>
<p>We all believe in change. Experimenting new things in life is always a fun.  Early 20’s is probably the best age when you can try new things and see what best suits you.simply saying that it would not do good to me will take you nowhere. Try taking risks,even if you  fail you will learn something out of it.
</p>

 <h2 class="section-heading">7.Failures are only lessons.</h2>

<p>Committing a mistake is a part of life.Humans are bound to make mistakes.But every mistakes teaches us a lesson, Learn from it.mistakes are also valuable teachers, if we can only learn to listen. we learn from failures and not from success.
</p>
 <h2 class="section-heading">8.Getting angry can be good for you? Yes it can!!</h2>

<p>
Getting angry over a matter can help you realize your faults and will give you time to talk to yourself. Initially you will be frustrated but as the time pass you will see a change in yourself.
</p>

 <h2 class="section-heading">9.To achieve something, you need to step out of Your Comfort Zone.</h2>

<p>Don't be hesitant to attempt new things, don't be reluctant to commit mistakes and most vital, don't be reluctant to gain from these mistakes.</p>


 <h2 class="section-heading">10.Surround yourself with people who motivate you.</h2>

<p>If you’re unhappy with yourself and wish to change your life, you need to change the individuals you stick around with. Invest time with individuals who help you and have confidence in you.
